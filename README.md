# All-types-of-Java-Layouts-In-a-single-frame
# 🎨 Java Swing Layout Showcase

A vibrant showcase of **six layout managers** in Java Swing, elegantly arranged within a single frame for visual comparison and learning. The highlight is that all the buttons are clickable, and each layout has its own impressive functionality.

## 🚀 About the Project

This project presents a hands-on GUI that explores the following layout managers:

- 📐 **BorderLayout**
- 🧩 **GridLayout**
- 🌊 **FlowLayout**
- 🧱 **GridBagLayout**
- 🎁 **BoxLayout**
- 🎴 **CardLayout** (with interactive switching!)

Each layout is color-coded, labeled, and displayed in a dedicated panel—allowing users to intuitively experience how components behave in different layout settings.
